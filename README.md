List of directories
---

- combination: return all possible combinations of n choose k
- container: stores any type of data
- diffdir: vimdiff over many directories
- directory: allow to search for a file in directories
- factorial: implements of a naive factorial function for int (actually, used
  to test Chrono.hpp)
- fit: wrapper of the library cminpack.h that uses the Levenberg-Marquardt
  algorithm
- gnuplot: write a gnuplot script and provide a "compiler" for gnuplot files
  (\*.gp->\*.pdf/\*.png/\*.jpg)
- header: allows to write a header(footer) in a \*.jdbin file
- interpolation: use of radial basis functions to perform multi-dimensional fits
- iofiles: custom file format that works with my other classes and allow easy
  read/write processes of text or binary files
- jdtools: allows to find, read and convert \*.jdbin files
- lib : **main folder containing all source files for all custom classes**
- linux:  allows to launch system command
- list: custom linked list that supports my other classes
- matrix-lapack: naive implementation matrices (for *double* and
  *std::complex<double>*) that allows an easy use of LAPACK routines via the
  class Lapack
- miscellaneous:  defines a namespace *my* with simple tools
- multi-dim-array: failed and aborted attempt to create multi-dimensional arrays
- optimisation: implement a simple optimisation algorithm 
- parseur: récupère les arguments du main et fourni une méthode d'assertion de valeur
- prime: génère les n premiers nombres premier
- pso: Particle Swarm Optimisation algorithm
- pstricks2pdf: create a pstriks figure from a \*.tex file
- rand: random numbers generator provided by Sandro Sorella
- rst: provides tools to write a rst file
- run: allow to run a software exactly n times when it is launched N>n time
- sampling: class that performs the binning analysis during the Monte-Carlo
  process. **could be improved a lot by using M.Troyer's idea**
- time: class that handle the time, chrono
- tofraction: simple method that transform a fractional number to fraction
- young: compute the product of Young tableaux
